# Webscraping and automate testing with Selenium 

## What is it?


Is an **open source** module, that provides many testing tools and webscraping elements. Requires **higher coding skills** when compared with other web testing comercial softwares (all of them paid). Supports **multiple programming languages** like Java, Python, CSharp, Ruby, JavaScript and Kotlin. 

## What we will do?
1. We are going to explore the different options and capabilities of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/). 
2. Live-code an example in a test website. 
3. See how to test a webpage with different cases, users, check and detect unexpected behaviors or bugs. 
4. (If time enough) Will get some important elements of a webpage like title, headers, source code, imbedded links.

## What are people going to get after the talk?
1. An overview of the capabilities of this module. 
2. A better idea of how to conduct automate testing for a website when is being develop.
3. Will show one more tool to do webscraping and show pros and cons among other webscraper when wanting to get some specific information of the HTML.
